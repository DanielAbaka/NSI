                  	Thank you for visiting our website. I appreciate that you took time to surf through and know more about us.
					When I founded the company in 2010, the initial vision was quite small, the primary idea was to increase my 
					income and make impact in my country Liberia by providing simple ICT services to my immediate environment 
					along with my friends who also had the same vision; because I was actually broke - very broke. I took three 
					months to register the company. I was working but I wasn’t earning much. I trekked so many times in the 
					scorching sun through town moving from shop to shop seeking to identify I.T problem I can solve. I had a 
					deep-seated belief that although we all set out to make a difference in the world, but the first step was 
					for me to achieve the less-lofty goal of changing my own World. As it got better, the vision enlarged, I began 
					to see greater possibilities, I realized that the World needed our manifestation in such a larger way; and that
					true and lasting Success is in helping the world become better than I met it. Solving human need, using technology to improve lives
					and business process. It became more imperative to make a generational impact that leaves an indelible print in the sands of time.<br/><br/>

					When we started, it was quite tough, we didn’t even had an office space, it didn't make sense that I 
					wanted to provide I.T services yet I had no office, I had to borrow money from my mom to get an office space and started business with my friends 
					(Richard B. Allen, Gordon Harris, and Maweayata Sow) at the office located on 11th Street Sinkor, Monrovia, Liberia. <br/><br/>

					It's been quite an inspirational journey, there's too much to tell you about how far we have come as a company; the wins, the losses, 
					the disappointments, etc. There were several dark and melancholy moments that I was completely frustrated! It took persistence, determination, 
					faith and a sense of burden to change my world and the world of those around me. The vision eventually got bigger to affect more lives 
					particularly that of other young and brilliant ones who needed a springboard to also grow and become financially empowered. We built a team! 
					We began to look for problems that we can use Software to solve, and we identified opportunities that could be harnessed to help clients have 
					a more efficient business processes.<br/><br/>

					Today, as you can see, by the grace of God we have transformed into something absolutely beautiful and awe-inspiring. We are a testimony to every 
					African youth that they can achieve success; and that one can indeed grow from zero into abundance. We continue to serve our customers with quality 
					and be-spoke I.T solutions, ranging from website designs, network (cctv, intercom, server, video conferencing) installation, interactive multimedia, 
					to customized software development - building applications that solve the core business hurdles of the African businessman or woman.<br/><br/>
